### SOLID Principles Implementation

#### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **LabFila**: Only handles queue and ticket management
- **LabPainel**: Only handles display and real-time updates
- **LabRelatorio**: Only handles reporting and analytics
- **Core**: Only defines contracts and domain models

#### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- New ticket types can be added without modifying existing code
- New display formats can be implemented without changing core logic
- New report types can be added through extension points

#### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Any implementation of ITicketService can replace another
- Different display implementations can be swapped seamlessly
- Repository implementations are interchangeable

#### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Modules only depend on interfaces they actually use
- Small, focused interfaces instead of large, monolithic ones
- Clear separation between different service concerns

#### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- Both depend on abstractions
- Dependencies are injected, not hard-coded

### Inter-Module Communication

#### Event-Driven Architecture
```csharp
// Example: Ticket issued event
public class TicketIssuedEvent : IEvent
{
    public int TicketId { get; set; }
    public string ExamType { get; set; }
    public bool IsPriority { get; set; }
    public DateTime IssuedAt { get; set; }
}

// Modules subscribe to events they care about
public class DisplayService : IEventHandler<TicketIssuedEvent>
{
    public void Handle(TicketIssuedEvent @event)
    {
        // Update display when ticket is issued
    }
}
```

#### Interface Contracts
- **Loose Coupling**: Modules communicate through well-defined interfaces
- **Contract-First**: Interfaces are defined before implementation
- **Versioning**: Interface changes are carefully managed

## Development Workflow

### Daily Standups
- **Time**: 15 minutes daily
- **Focus**: Progress, blockers, coordination
- **Format**: What I did, What I'll do, Any blockers

### Sprint Planning
- **Duration**: 2 hours at start of each sprint
- **Agenda**: Review backlog, estimate tasks, assign responsibilities
- **Output**: Sprint backlog with clear acceptance criteria

### Sprint Review & Retrospective
- **Duration**: 1 hour at end of each sprint
- **Review**: Demo working software to stakeholders
- **Retrospective**: What went well, what to improve, action items

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Module Coupling**: Regular architecture reviews to ensure low coupling
- **Performance**: Early performance testing and optimization
- **Integration**: Continuous integration and automated testing

### Team Risks
- **Knowledge Silos**: Pair programming and code reviews
- **Dependencies**: Clear task dependencies and communication
- **Scope Creep**: Strict adherence to sprint goals

## Success Metrics

### Sprint Goals
- **Sprint 1**: Architecture foundation complete, basic structure working
- **Sprint 2**: Core functionality operational, real-time communication working
- **Sprint 3**: Complete system integrated, tested, and deployable

### Quality Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% unit test coverage
- **Performance**: Sub-3 second response time for ticket generation
- **Reliability**: 99% uptime during development and testing

### Team Metrics
- **Velocity**: Consistent story points completion per sprint
- **Quality**: Reduced bug count in subsequent sprints
- **Collaboration**: Effective cross-module communication and integration

## Tools & Technologies

### Development Environment
- **Version Control**: Git with feature branch workflow
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps
- **Testing**: Unit testing framework, integration testing tools
- **Documentation**: Markdown, API documentation tools

### Architecture Tools
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in .NET DI or Autofac
- **Event Bus**: MediatR or custom implementation
- **Real-time**: SignalR or WebSocket implementation
- **Database**: Entity Framework Core with repository pattern

This organization ensures that each sprint has clear deliverables while maintaining the modular architecture principles throughout the development process.

# GerenciaLab - Laboratory Queue Management System

## Overview
GerenciaLab is a queue management system designed to optimize patient flow in clinical laboratories. It replaces manual paper-based ticketing with an automated solution that categorizes exams, prioritizes special needs patients (elderly, pregnant women, people with disabilities), and provides real-time queue tracking.

## Problem Statement
Current laboratory operations rely on:
- Physical paper tickets with no exam type differentiation
- First-come-first-served manual queues
- No standardized priority system
- Chaotic peak hour situations
- No performance metrics collection

This leads to:
- Patient dissatisfaction
- Inefficient resource allocation
- Unmanaged wait times
- Operational confusion

## Solution Features
### Core Modules:
1. **LabFila**
   - Ticket issuance system
   - Queue organization by exam type
   - Priority classification
   - Staff interface for call management

2. **LabPainel**
   - Digital display screens
   - Real-time call notifications
   - Visual/audio alerts
   - Priority and location indicators

3. **LabRelat√≥rio**
